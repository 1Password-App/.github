## What is 1Password?

**1Password** is an award-winning, industry-leading password manager and digital vault trusted by millions of individuals, families, and businesses worldwide. It goes far beyond simple password storage, offering a secure and seamless solution for managing your entire digital life. Your sensitive information—including passwords, credit cards, secure notes, personal documents, and software licenses—is protected by **military-grade encryption** (AES-256) and a **secret key** that only you know, ensuring your data is unreadable even to 1Password.

Unlike using the same weak password everywhere or relying on insecure browser storage, 1Password generates and stores **strong, unique passwords** for every account. It automatically fills them in apps and websites with a single click or keyboard shortcut, making security effortless. Features like **Watchtower** alert you to data breaches, weak passwords, and expiring credit cards, helping you stay proactive about your security. Whether you're on **Windows 11**, **macOS**, **iOS**, or **Android**, your vault syncs instantly across all your devices, providing secure access anywhere.

For teams and businesses, **1Password Business** provides robust admin controls, activity reports, and secure sharing features, making it the definitive solution for organizational security without compromising usability. Its intuitive design, unwavering commitment to privacy (audited independently), and powerful feature set make 1Password the most reliable way to secure your digital identity.
